   <h2>Methodology</h2>
   <p>Our training program utilizes a modular approach. Players will follow a fixed daily routine that is coordinated by the professional team and support staff. The program is very full, yet it aims to achieve a balance between lectures, practice sessions on the field, experimental activities, field trips, social functions and free time. </p>

   <p>The starting point is the rugby and life skills evaluation, which takes place during the first week. This provides the basis on which specific individual goals will be developed within each player. It also provides the basis for evaluating both the players and the course throughout the year.</p>

   <p>During the course players will undergo coaching in modules focusing primarily on:</p>
