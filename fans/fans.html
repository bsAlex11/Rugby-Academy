           <p id="fra-eng">Famously dubbed ‘Le Crunch’, you sense the deep-rooted dislike here goes all the way back to Hastings, Agincourt, Crécy, Yorktown, Trafalgar, Waterloo  or maybe all of them. Ever since those famous battles France and England have traded blows and none more so than on the rugby field. It all started on 22 March 1906 at Parc des Princes when England ran out 35-8 winners. France’s first win came in 1927 at Stade Colombes when Grenoble wing Edmond Vellat’s try was the solitary score. Increasingly formidable, especially in Paris, it was honours even for most of the 1950s and 1960s, indeed 1959-61 saw three consecutive drawn matches in the Five Nations but, after winning their first ever Grand Slam in 1968, France hit the 1970s running and started to really flex their muscles. Over the years there has been plenty of panache as well, notably at Twickenham in 1991 when England may have won the Grand Slam but the game is remembered mainly for Philippe Saint-André’s try which was recently voted the greatest in Twickenham history. </p>
           <p id="ire-eng">A fixture which has 'history' - and not all of it on the field. The complicated relationship between the two countries often finds its most eloquent expression on the rugby field, and there is no scalp that the Irish prize more highly. One of Ireland's most memorable victories in their rugby history came in the 43-13 thumping they dished out to the English in 2007, a win made all the sweeter by virtue of coming at Croke Park, an arena redolent with its own unhappy history - although the feelings do not just run one way. When Martin Johnson refused to budge for the Irish president Mary McAleese for a pre-match presentation at Lansdowne Road in 2003 - England had lined up on Ireland's preferred left-hand side of the red carpet, in a memorable display of bloody-mindedness - the cheers could be heard across the Irish Sea.</p>
           <p id="nz-fra">This fixture has produced some of the greatest World Cup matches in the tournament’s history. The mesmerising, and still not quite believable, the French win against a Jonah Lomu inspired All Blacks and 2007’s repeat upset in Cardiff will both live on in rugby folklore. France almost did it again in the 2011 final. Stricter reffing at the breakdown may well have seen them overcome the one point deficit that cost them their first title. France also famously became the first team to win a series in New Zealand without losing a game. Their ‘try from the end of the world’ to clinch the series late in the second test can still make true rugby connoisseurs weep with joy. France possesses the best win ration against New Zealand of all northern hemisphere teams.</p>
           <p id="eng-sco">International rugby’s original rivalry. The teams first met (complete with 20 players a side) back in 1871 and have been at it hammer and tongs ever since for the Calcutta Cup. Sadly, for Scottish fans at least, the one-sided nature of fixture in recent years has taken the sheen off the contest a little in terms of competitiveness. Anyone wishing to see what this fixture means to Scotland should view the infamous 1990 clash when David Sole and co broke English grand slam dreams. The fixture does sometimes bring moments of mutual love and cooperation though. In 1989 Scotland’s John Jeffery and England’s Dean Richards shared a drunken kick around with the Calcutta Cup on the streets of Edinburgh. Repairing it wasn’t cheap.</p>
           <p id="aus-nz"> A classic case of sibling rivalry which has turned into something a little more serious as the years have rolled past. For New Zealand, the opportunity to give big brother - at least in political, economic and geographical terms - a bloody nose a few times a year is one that is simply too good to be passed up.</p>
           <p id="eng-wal">The Scots, French and Irish may want to be England each year as much as Wales, but two factors make this the big one in the northern part of the globe. First, Wales’ national identity is intrinsically linked to rugby - a game that unites a nation and cuts across class barriers in a way in never has in England means there is a particular edge to this match. Secondly, Wales’ superior record against England compared to the other northern hemispheres means this is no one way rivalry. Welsh captain Phil Bennett once gave a team talk that went: “We've been exploited, raped, controlled and punished by the English – and that's who you are playing this afternoon.”</p>
