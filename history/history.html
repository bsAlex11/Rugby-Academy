                 <p>William Webb Ellis, "with a fine disregard for the rules of football...first took the ball in his arms and ran with it" </p>                               
                
                    <div class="hidden">
                      <p>The precise origins of Rugby are argued to this day, but the most widely accepted theory has it that the Game was born in 1823, on the playing fields of Rugby School in Warwickshire, England. On that day a 16-year-old pupil named William Webb Ellis showed blatant disregard for the rules of a playground ball game by catching the ball (which was allowed) and running forwards with it (which was not). As a result, Webb Ellis is credited in most quarters as being the inventor of the earliest form of Rugby. </p>

                <h3> The Rules are Made </h3>
                <p>As the popularity of this new ball game spread, the first set of Rugby rules were established </p>                               
             
                 <div class="hidden">
                      <p>As the popularity of this new ball game spread, the first set of Rugby rules were established. Devised by three senior Rugby School pupils and totalling 37 points in all, many of them related to the methods of point scoring and the position and role of specific trees within the school’s grounds. But Rule 20 was interesting, outlining that Games could last for up to five days – with breaks for sleep naturally factored in. And as those Rugby School students graduated and moved on, the Game’s reputation spread across the country and further afield. </p>

                      <h3>A Common Code  </h3>
                      <p>Because there were just too many variations on the rules, the Rugby Football Union was formed to unify the rules of the game </p>                               
                  
                      <div class="hidden">
                         <p>Up until 1871, there were just too many variations on the rules. The Rugby Football Union was formed to unify the rules , not to mention clamp down on some of the more aggressive approaches to Rugby taking place around the country. Soon after, the world’s first international match took place at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. Before a crowd of 4,000, Scotland beat England by one goal. At that time matches could only be decided by kicking; each try led to a conversion and the chance to ‘try’ to kick at goal for a point.  </p>

                           <h3> The Establishment </h3>
                           <p>After the formation of the English Rugby Football Union, similar organisations were formed in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. </p>                               
                  
                     <div class="hidden">
                         <p>With the Rugby Football Union in place, the remaining home unions were swiftly established – first with the Scottish Football Union in 1873, then the Irish Rugby Football Union in 1874 and the South Wales Football Union in 1875. An International Championship between the four nations was the next logical step and was duly introduced in 1882. But the lack of a formal points system early on led to frequent disputes over who had won and who had lost.  </p>

                           <p>The game was swiftly carried across the globe to many far-flung parts of the British Empire and its colonies </p>                               
                  
                     <div class="hidden">
                         <p>The Game was swiftly carried across the globe to many far-flung parts of the British Empire and its colonies, often by ball-carrying British troops stationed overseas. As the Game grew, Australia’s Southern Rugby Union was established in 1874, followed by the South African Rugby Football Board in 1889 and the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892. A year later the New Zealand RFU formally adopted the all-black playing strip that terrifies opponents to this day.  </p>

                           <p>After decades of growth, the game was torn in two when some of the players pushed to be compensated for the loss of income incurred by representing their teams </p>                               
                  
                     <div class="hidden">
                         <p>After decades of rapid growth, the game was spectacularly torn in two in 1893, when players from Rugby’s northern clubs pushed to be compensated for the loss of working hours and income incurred by representing their teams. They wanted to be paid to play, in other words. The Rugby Football Union took a very dim view of this, considering payment to be a grave violation of the Game’s strict amateur code, so a 22 club-strong Northern Rugby Union was formed in 1895, which eventually became Rugby League in 1922.  </p>

                         <p>After almost a century of steady evolution, the game embraced another major change in 1987 when New Zealand and Australia co-hosted the inaugural Rugby World Cup. A 16-team, 32-game affair played out in the British summer of 1987, New Zealand overpowered France in the Final to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time.  </p>

                         <p>In the most recent alteration to Rugby’s scoring, tries were increased from four to five points in 1992, in an attempt to promote a more attractive brand of running Rugby and dissuade teams from simply kicking their way to victory. </p>

                         <p>Having resisted calls to embrace professionalism for more than a century, the International Rugby Board finally relented in 1995 by announcing that the game was now “open”. This meant they were finally accepting professionalism, removing all restrictions on payments to players and embracing a brave new era for Rugby. </p>
