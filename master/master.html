      <div class="description" id="pass-text" data-section="pass"> 

         <p><strong>Passing</strong> is one of the fundamental techniques in rugby used to move the ball down the pitch towards the try-line whilst maintaining speed and motion. There are various types of passes which players use, depending on their position, the amount of power required and the 
         direction the ball is being passed. Whilst players can move across the pitch in any direction, they may only pass the ball to their side or behind them and will be penalised for passing forwards. </p>
         <h5>The Lateral Pass </h5>
         <p>The lateral pass is the most basic pass in rugby union, used for middle distance sideways and backwards throws. It is crucial that the lateral pass is made at chest height to prevent the receiver from having to look down and take their eyes of the defence.</p>
         <h5>The Pop Pass </h5>
         <p>A variation of the lateral pass, the pop pass is used for short, close-distance passes, requiring the player to use power from their forearms and throw the ball with only a slight flick of the wrist, rather than a swing across the body as is required for longer passes.</p>
         <h5>Switch Pass </h5>
         <p>The switch pass aims to change the direction of play by confusing the opponent and opening up a space for other members of the team to run through. </p>
         <h5>The Dummy Pass </h5>
         <p>A technique used to trick an opponent, the dummy pass requires the player carrying the ball to feign a passing motion, sending the defence over to the supposed target player and allowing the ball carrier a window of opportunity to sprint away from the defence.</p>  
    </div>    

    <div class="description" id="tackle-text" data-section="tackle">
         
         <p><strong>Tackling</strong> is the act of bringing a player down to the ground when he is carrying the ball. Though the technique is often acquired easily with a bit of practice, there are a number of rules for what can and cannot happen in a tackle, mostly due to safety concerns, and so the most important part is to know these rules well in order to avoid penalties. </p>
         <p>When, where, why and how you make a rugby tackle is an important part of the game. Know what tacklers and tackled players are and what you must do. Only one player can be tackled - the ball carrier. Any number of players can be involved in taking the ball carrier to the ground.  </p>
         <p>The tackled player must:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Avoid postioning in a way that prevents the opposition from getting possession </li>
               <li>Pass the ball or release it </li>
               <li>Get up or move away (leaving the ball where it is) </li>
           </ul> 
          <p>The tackler must: </p> 
           <ul>
              <li>Make sure that there is no contact above the shoulders </li>
              <li>Release the tackled player (when they have been grounded) </li>
              <li>Move away from the tackled player and the ball </li>          
           </ul>   
    </div>  

    
    <div class="description" id="ruck-text" data-section="ruck">
        
         <p>A <strong>ruck</strong> occurs when a player (or players) from each side make contact with each other over the ball, which is on the ground. The aim of the ruck is for the players in each team to move their opponents out of the area, and to manoeuvre the ball toward their respective sides of the ruck so that play can go on from that point. This is achieved by ‘rucking’ the ball to move it from under the bodies of players on the ground. The players should manage to release the ball from a ruck within about five seconds. If this does not happen, the referee will award a scrum to the team that seemed to be making the most progress in the ruck. </p>
         <p>Because of the strength of many rugby players, injuries can happen if both sides don’t stick to the rules and the referee’s decisions. This is why it is so important to follow some basic pointers which will help everyone to enjoy a game safely:</p>
           <ul>
              <li>Players involved in a ruck should try to stay standing </li>
              <li>If the player in possession of the ball does fall, they must make sure to let go of the ball as soon as they reach the ground. If they attempt to hold onto the ball so that the other team can’t get to it, the referee will award a penalty </li>            
              <li>Heads/shoulders of players must be at or above hip height </li>
              <li>Players must avoid collapsing the ruck </li>
              <li>Each team has an offside line, parallel to other lines across the pitch and just behind the player's foot furthest back in the ruck </li>
              <li>To join the ruck you must arrive from behind the imaginary offside line and bind to the player who is furthest back in the ruck </li>
              <li>According to the rules, a ruck ends successfully when the ball leaves the ruck </li>
           </ul> 
    </div>  

    <div class="description" id="maul-text" data-section="maul">

        <p>A <strong>maul</strong> is created when the player handling the ball is held up (but not tackled) by an opposing player, and at least one team-mate of the player in possession of the ball binds to the ball-holder. Therefore a maul needs at least three players, with two of these coming from the same side. In this situation, the ball should still be in a player’s hands, not on the ground, and all of the players involved have to attempt to stay on their feet. Rugby Union rules also say that, to officially be a maul, the players must be heading towards a goal line. </p>
        <p>The referee will penalise any unsafe practice, which includes: </p>
          <ul>
             <li>Collapsing the maul on purpose </li>
             <li>Not binding properly to the other players once you have joined the maul. Binding means making contact with those on either side of you, and the correct way to do this is to make sure you are touching them with your whole arm – from wrist to shoulder </li>
             <li>Dragging an opponent out of a maul </li>
             <li>A player must either join a maul, or retire behind the offside line immediately. If a player loiters at the side of a maul, the player is offside </li>
          </ul>
          <p>A maul ends successfully when: </p> 
          <ul>
            <li>The ball or a player with the ball leaves the maul </li>
            <li>The ball is on the ground </li>
            <li>The ball is on or over the goal line </li>
          </ul>   
    </div>

    <div class="description" id="scrum-text" data-section="scrum">

         <p>A <strong>scrum</strong> is short for "scrummage", and it is a frequent and very important element of rugby. Used as a way of restarting the game when the ball has gone out of play, the scrum consists of a formation of players whereby each team’s designated forwards bind together in three rows with the heads of those in the front row interlocking with those in the front row of the opposing team. The ball is then thrown into the gap between the two teams and both sides must compete to try and hook the ball and send it back with their feet. During the scrum, both sets of forwards push against the opposition to attempt to gain possession of the ball (referred to as ‘contesting the scrum’). </p> 
         <p>The scrum formation is often tricky to master for new players, as the positioning has specific rules and the pattern has to be just right. The scrum is formed by eight players from each team, bounded together in three rows for each team, closed up with their opponents so that the heads of the front rows are interlocked. This creates a tunnel into which a scrum half throws the ball so that front row players can compete for possession by hooking the ball with either of their feet. </p>
         <p>The front row usually consists of three players. These will often be the heaviest or stockiest players as they will have to bear more of the weight. The three people in the front row are made up of a hooker in the middle, with a prop on either side to support the hooker and contribute to the power of the pushing. One of these props is known as a tighthead prop and he goes to the right, while the other one is the loosehead prop and goes to the left. There should be no gap between the three and they should bind together very tightly. The rules for this are quite strict – failure to bind using the whole arm results in a penalty with the opposition being awarded a free kick. </p>
         <p>On the second row of the scrum there must be only two players which line up directly behind the front row, positioning their heads in between the heads of the front hooker and props. These two players are the locks, as their role is to further tighten the gap between the players and ensure that the movement of the pack is as powerful as possible. </p>
         <p>Finally, the last row contains three players, who yet again interlock their heads with those of the row in front of them. </p>
         <p>When the formation is complete, both packs must approach each other and stand at arms length. The referee then gives the crouching order by saying "crouch", at which point the two front rows must assume a crouching position whereby their backs are parallel to the ground with their heads and shoulders higher than their hips.

The referee then says "touch" and each front row player must touch the opposite player’s shoulder to make sure the two rows are not too far apart.

Next, the referee says "pause" to inspect the scrum and finally shouts "engage", at which point the two sets come together, with the props holding on to their opponent prop’s jerseys. </p>
         <p>The scrum halves of the team in possession of the ball then throws the ball into the gap between the two rows (respectively known as the put-in and the tunnel) and the hookers compete for possession with the entire pack jostling to make the task of hooking more difficult. </p>
    </div> 

     <div class="description" id="line-text" data-section="line">

          <p>Used in rugby, a <strong>line-out</strong> is awarded to a member of the opposing team if the ball is kicked into touch (out of the field of play) during a match. A line-out requires each team to form a line of players across the pitch at a distance of 1 metre apart from each other with the line of touch passing through the centre of the gap. The ball is then thrown in from off the pitch by the hooker of the team in possession and the players attempt to catch the ball or to pass it down to the scrum-half, who is usually positioned just outside of the line-out in a close enough position to receive the ball once a member of their team has caught it.</p>
          <p>Rules of a line-out: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each team must have a minimum of two players and a maximum of fourteen players in the line-out  </li>
            <li>The opposing team are not permitted to have more players in the line-out than the throwing-in team but they are permitted to have less </li>
            <li>Players are not allowed to tackle a player of the opposing team when they are jumping for the ball </li>
            <li>Players are not allowed to use a member of the opposition as support when they are jumping to catch the ball </li>
            <li>No player is allowed to move into the gap between the opposing lines unless they are in the act of jumping for the ball </li>
          </ul>  
     </div>

     <div class="description" id="kick-text" data-section="kick">

        <p><strong>Kicking</strong> is an integral component of the game of rugby and serves many purposes. To kick is to relinquish possession of the ball, thus there is an undeniable tactical element every time a ball is kicked. It is also a specialist skill which tends to be carried out by only a select number of players on the pitch. </p>
        <p>The term kicking is very broad and should firstly be broken down into subcategories; defensive, attacking, starting/restarting play, and point scoring. History proves that established kickers nearly always play in the backs and are typically outside halves (no.10s). </p>
        <p>In defence </p>
          <p>When under considerable territorial pressure, the option of clearing your lines through kicking up-field is used frequently. A well executed defensive kick will provide respite and an opportunity for the team to regroup. </p>
          <p>The best defensive clearance kicks tend to be courtesy of the ‘torpedo’ kick. This is when a right footed player aims to the left touchline (or vice versa) and kicks the ball on the outside of his boot, creating the ‘torpedo’ effect. An effective torpedo kick is not easy to perform but, due to its curved flight path, provides maximum territorial gains. </p>
          <p>In attack</p>
           <p>When in an attacking position, kicking can be used as a tactical ploy. Admittedly all subtypes come with a side order of risk, but if performed accurately and in the correct situation, they can lead to tries which ultimately win matches. </p>
           <p>The up-and-under, otherwise known as the ‘garryowen’ named after the Irish team who introduced the tactic), is performed by kicking the ball high into the air. The reasoning behind this most simple of concepts is that the ball’s return to earth coincides with the arrival of the chasing players. This creates an opportunity to reclaim possession, as the receiving player is under incredible pressure to make the catch. </p>
           
     </div>

     <div class="description" id="finish-text" data-section="finish">

        <p>A <strong>try</strong> is a way of scoring points in. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). </p>
        <p>The goal line is part of the in-goal. If an attacking player is first to ground the ball on the opponents’ goal line, a try is scored. The goal posts and padding surrounding them are part of the goal line, which is part of in-goal. If an attacking player is first to ground the ball against a goal post or padding, a try is scored. </p>
        <p>When a player scores a try it gives the player’s team the right to attempt to score a goal by taking a kick at goal; this also applies to a penalty try. This kick is a conversion kick: a conversion kick can be a place kick or a drop kick. </p>
        <p>Penalty try. A penalty try is awarded if a try would probably have been scored but for foul play by the defending team. A penalty try is awarded if a try would probably have been scored in a better position but for foul play by the defending team. </p>
